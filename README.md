# Predicting-Combat-Power-in-Pokemon

Pokemon Go was a phenomenon that took the world by surprise. Over 28 million users downloaded the app in the first week of its release and as of January 2017 it the franchise sold over 1 billion in merchandise!

I'm also a Pokemon GO player and I wanted to use my data science skills to design a Pokemon Simulator which is slightly like a game.

Instead, you simply use Pokémon Simulator to reproduce the combats between different Pokémon. This makes it great for learning the strengths and weaknesses of the various characters. Pokémon Simulator features characters from all the Pokémon that have appeared in the various editions. If you're a fan of the games, Pokémon Simulator will give you an extra edge in your battles.

Also, you can visit my pokemon website to play with it [&lt;here&gt;](https://)
